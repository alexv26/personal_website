            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
              I am a rising senior at Boston College, studying Computer Science
              (BS) and pursuing a minor in Management and Leadership. Throughout
              my life I have been interested in problem-solving, and computer
              science is the perfect way for me to channel this passion into a
              career. NBeyond the problem-solving inherent in coding itself, the
              applications we create provide practical solutions to significant
              real-world challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alongside my passion for computer science, I also have a deep love
              for the outdoors. When I was young, my dad introduced me to the
              Cub Scouts, where I gained my first meaningful outdoor
              experiences. I continued through the Boy Scouts program,
              ultimately earning the Eagle Scout awardâ€”the highest honor in
              scouting. In college I wanted to continue that experience, so I
              joined Boston College's Outdoor Adventures program as a trip
              leader, and lead trips across New England for the community to
              enjoy. This coming year, I am serving as the club's Co-Captain,
              and hope to be able to create a welcoming and accessible
              environment for all.
            </p>
            <p>
              To further my committment to leadership and serving my community,
              I began pursuing a minor in Management and Leadership. Throughout
              my early career, between my jobs at Tatte bakery, the BC
              Intramural program, and the IT department at BC, I have observed
              the incredible value an effective manager brings to a team
              environment. This program equips me to build stronger teams, not
              only by enhancing productivity but also by nurturing collaboration
              and positive relationships.
